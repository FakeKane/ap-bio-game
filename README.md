# ap-bio-game
A game to demonstrate the processes of cellular respiration for students.

## Ideas:
* Sidebar with information and directions
* Toolbar with molecules to drag and drop
* Start with glycolysis
* First have tutorial, then move onto game aspect
  * Have screen to choose which one to start with
